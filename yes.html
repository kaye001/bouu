    <h2>Happy Valentineâ€™s bou</h2>
    I just wanted you to know, that nobody has ever made me feel like this in a long time ago. I guess it's been completely a year since I've lost interest in love Thanks for choosing me. bou, No matter what I say when I'm feeling down, please take my words seriously. I'm an attention seeker of yours I love it if you notice and remember all the small things and actions of mine no matter what it's always going to be me and you, in the end. I want to thank you for loving me like nobody has done this to me thanks for not leaving me thank you for being patient with me thank you for everything, I want you to be the happiest woman alive. Even I miss usually without telling good night or even texting me its kinda hurt's but that's ok I know you are tired... But let me know you're going to sleep or you will sleepy.. like I do coz it makes me think that You don't love me anymore I love this DISTANCE between us cause it makes me miss you more and love you more hope you feel the same l can say several times to remind you that you are the closest to my heart & no one can ever come in between us, even if meet someone else or someone tries to break our bond I know whatever we have is so special and rare that we will never get separated. we were strangers we didn't know that we would be close to each other later, I am so lucky to have you in my life because from my pain to my happiness to my anger to my worst side you have felt it all, you stayed, loved and cared and all I can say is I LOVE YOU SO MUCH TYRA I AM PROUD TO HAVE YOU IN MY LIFE.
    <h3>Tyra Dili man tika permi makita pero always remember perminte tika-gihunahuna. ikaw ang bugtong itik nga nagkapa kapa sa malapokon kong dughan..ug ikaw ang ting nga naga bagting sa akong kasing kasing ug saksi ang mga unggoy nga nag langoy langoy kilid sa hagonoy sa akong gumgma ikaw ra ang gi ila.
